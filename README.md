# **OctoPod – Smarter Studying Through Personalized Practice**

## **Overview**

Studying can be frustrating—especially when you’re not sure whether you actually understand the material. You can read notes, review examples, or browse various AI tools, yet still end up unsure of what you really know.
**OctoPod** solves this problem by generating personalized practice questions based on the notes you upload. With endless custom questions and performance-based feedback, OctoPod helps you identify what you’ve mastered and what you need to study next.

OctoPod offers a simple, intuitive web interface with pages for **Home**, **Features**, **About**, **Contact**, and **Login**, making it easy to navigate and track your learning.

## **The Problem**

Most study tools tell you *what* to review, but not whether you truly understand the concepts. Even with today’s wealth of AI-powered resources, students often struggle to measure comprehension or identify weak spots.
There’s no clear way to test your understanding using your own study materials—and that’s where traditional tools fall short.

**OctoPod** takes your notes and transforms them into practice.
By uploading a simple `.txt` file, you can generate unlimited multiple-choice questions tailored to your material. After practicing, OctoPod gives you a **personalized study summary** that highlights the topics you struggled with. If you log in, OctoPod saves your progress and continuously updates your feedback as you improve—like an adaptive, always-available study partner.
